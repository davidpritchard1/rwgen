**RWGEN is a stochastic spatiotemporal Rainfall and Weather GENerator package**

RWGEN is based on the Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulse (NSRP) rainfall model. 
Weather variables (e.g. temperature) are simulated using autoregressive models. 
RWGEN calculates potential evapotranspiration using the FAO56 Penman-Moneith 
method.

The RWGEN package supports both single site (point) and spatial simulations. 
It contains functionality to support data pre-processing, model fitting, 
simulation and model evaluation.

Installation is described in the documentation.
