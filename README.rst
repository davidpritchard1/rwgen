RWGEN
=====

RWGEN is a stochastic spatiotemporal Rainfall and Weather GENerator based on
the Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulse (NSRP) rainfall model.

RWGEN supports both single site (point) and spatial rainfall simulations. It
can conduct data pre-processing, model fitting, simulation and post-processing.

The model and documentation are new and under active development - please check
back regularly for updates.

Demo Notebooks
--------------

A `demo`_ version of the rainfall model component can be tried in the browser
without the need for any Python knowledge or installation. To run the model
with your own data, please see the documentation.

Following the link above should load Jupyter in the default browser. If you
navigate into the `examples` folder you should find sub-folders containing the
Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks contain explanations and example usages of
the rainfall model.

Note that the load times for the demo notebook can vary, as it is hosted on the
free `mybinder`_ service. If it is being slow (more than a few minutes), try
closing the tab and reopening (or try again later).
