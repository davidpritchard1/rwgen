RWGEN
=====

RWGEN is a stochastic spatiotemporal Rainfall and Weather GENerator. It is
based on the Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulse (NSRP) rainfall model.

RWGEN supports both single site (point) and spatial rainfall simulations. It
can conduct data pre-processing, model fitting, simulation and post-processing.

Features under development include:
    * NSRP options/enhancements (including multiple raincell/storm types,
      defined storm radii, ...).
    * Simulation of non-rainfall weather variables (e.g. temperature) using
      autoregressive models.
    * Potential evapotranspiration calculations using the FAO56 Penman-Monteith
      method.
    * Climate change perturbations.
    * ...

Installation is described in the documentation (see ``docs`` folder).
