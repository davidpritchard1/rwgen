RWGEN
=====

RWGEN is a stochastic spatiotemporal Rainfall and Weather GENerator based on
the Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulse (NSRP) rainfall model.

RWGEN supports both single site (point) and spatial simulations. It can
conduct data pre-processing, model fitting, simulation and post-processing.

The model and documentation are new and under active development - please check
back regularly for updates.
