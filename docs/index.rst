RWGEN
=====

RWGEN is a stochastic spatiotemporal Rainfall and Weather GENerator based on
the Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulse (NSRP) rainfall model.

RWGEN supports both single site (point) and spatial rainfall simulations. It
can conduct data pre-processing, model fitting, simulation and post-processing.

Various features are under development, including NSRP options/enhancements,
non-rainfall weather (and potential evapotranspiration) components, climate
change perturbation capability, ... .
